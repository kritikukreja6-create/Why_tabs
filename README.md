 🧠 WhyTabs

Remember why you opened a tab — and decide what to do with it.

📌 Problem

We open dozens of browser tabs every day — tutorials, articles, products, docs — and then forget why we opened them.
This leads to tab overload, mental clutter, and wasted time.

💡 Solution

WhyTabs is a Chrome extension that helps users attach intent to every tab they open.
It remembers why a tab exists and gently reminds the user later, making tab management intentional instead of chaotic.

✨ Features

📝 Intent Notes
Save why you opened a tab (Study, Work, Shopping, Browsing, or custom note).

📊 Tab Dashboard
View all saved tabs with their purpose, timestamp, and status.

⏰ Smart Reminders
Get gentle reminders about tabs you haven’t revisited.

🧹 Tab Cleanup Mode
Identify unused tabs and decide whether to close, snooze, or keep them.

💾 Persistent Storage
All data is stored locally using Chrome Storage and survives browser restarts.
